Michael Jackson Leaving Neverland: The plot holes and conspiracy theories exploredFrom claims it was a one-sided documentary without comment from the Neverland staff, why Lisa Marie Presley or Debbie Rowe were not mentioned to what will happen to his musicVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soon8CancelPlay nowMichael Jackson accusers describe horrific abuse they allegedly sufferedByNatalie Corner09:58, 8 Mar 2019|comments The explosive Leaving Neverland documentary has left some burning questions.   Following the two-part film, which saw Wade Robson and James Safechuck speak extensively about the sexual abuse they allegedly endured at the hands of Michael Jackson , there have been more issues than answers.  Certain threads within Jackson's life and career were excluded from the film's timeline like his sister Janet, and his wives Lisa Marie Presley and Debbie Rowe.  The stomach-churning documentary reached its conclusion and prompted a massive reaction from viewers at home, with many claiming the film had totally convinced them of Jackson's guilt .  But there were plenty of plot holes and conspiracy theories left up in the air.

  In the four-hour documentary Wade and James talk about their alleged abuse in the shocking film, which aired in the UK for the first time on Channel 4 this week. It featured gruesome descriptions of child sex abuse, which left many feeling so physically ill they had to switch off. Both Wade and James went on to explain why they never spoke out about their torment before - and even defended Jackson publicly when he was accused of molesting other boys. Did their mums let it happen?  A big source of shock for some was their mum's fond memories of Jackson - and the fact they allowed their sons to share a bed with a grown man.  Despite not really knowing Jackson, Wade's mum Joy Robson left her seven-year-old alone at his Neverland ranch for five days while the rest of the family visited the Grand Canyon, and allowed them to share a bed every night.

 She was eventually so taken in by the star and his promises to help mentor her child prodigy son that she tore her whole family apart and moved to Los Angeles so they could be closer. James' mum Stephanie Safechuck was so close to Michael that she treated him like a son. She would wash his clothes and cook his dinner on his regular visits to her suburban home in California. And while she at first refused Jackson's request to let James sleep in his room, after getting to know him and growing to trust him, she agreed. They believed what they were told when their hotel rooms began to move further away from Michael's and their sons, that there wasn't a suite available. Both mums spoke fondly of the late singer, recalling how they had cars, shopping trips and champagne at their constant disposal.

 Was there a collective cover-up and how deep did it go? There were no accounts in the documentary from any members of Jackson's staff, who worked for the star at the Neverland ranch. Director Dan Reed told the Huffington Post that he saw "little value in including perspectives from people who didn't know what unfolded behind closed doors". While many of his staff remained silent, there have been some that have come forward with claims of witnessing Michael with young boys.  Maid Adrian McManus previously claimed to have discovered boy's underwear and a 'sex tape stash ', said she saw the singer "kissing and petting" young boys at his Neverland ranch but was too afraid to speak out after apparently receiving death threats.  In the second part of the documentary it was revealed that former maid Blanca Francia, who worked for Jacko from 1986 to 1991, received a $2 million out of court settlement after claims the singer molested her son Jason.

Michael Jackson Leaving Neverland: Viewers brand Jacko 'sick f**k' after damning finale

 It's believed that members of Michael's inner circle were aware of what was going on behind closed doors, or simply turned a blind eye. Questions have been raised about who would arrange transport for Safechuck and Robson when they were repeatedly invited to Neverland, and who was tidying up after them. Robson said in an interview with Oprah Winfrey: "It was very rare that Michael was alone. "He had a machine around him at all times. Secretaries organized most of my phone calls and cars to pick me up to bring me to him. "Security guards were always there outside of the door. There were so many people around. There’s no way that Michael could have abused at the level that he did and the number of kids that he did without a machine behind him helping him do that.”

 What has Macaulay Culkin said about his relationship with Michael Jackson? Wade Robson mentioned that during his relationship with the singer, he felt pushed aside by Macaulay Culkin. At the height of his Home Alone fame in 1990, Macaulay became close friends with Michael and regularly stayed at Neverland, and went on to star in his video for Black and White. According to Wade a similar pattern of friendship emerged with the child star who would describe shopping sprees and childlike sleepovers.

 But Macaulay has always flatly denied he was inappropriately touched by Jacko and that when they shared a bed it was completely innocent. The actor testified in the 2005 court case following claims of sexual abuse by 12-year-old Gavin Arvizo, saying that claims by a maid that she had seen Culkin being touched by the singer as "absolutely ridiculous". Culkin spoke about Jackson as recently as January 2018 on a podcast saying: "He was my best friend growing up for a good, fat stretch of my life. "He enjoyed my youthfulness. He liked being a kid with me. It never struck me as odd. I never felt uncomfortable. That was just the way he was."

 Has Michael's sister Janet Jackson ever commented on the accusations? Many of Michael's family members have been outspoken about defending their brother, but Janet has remained on the periphery.  She spoke in support for Michael after Jordan Chandler's father Evan brought a lawsuit against him claiming his son had been sexually abused by the star .  The Chandler family sued the star themselves in a $30million lawsuit that accused him of sexual battery. In 1994 the case was settled out of court for $23million. Jordy refused to testify against the singer and the district attorneys said their investigation failed to produce evidence and they could not file criminal charges without Jordan's cooperation. Janet said during a rare interview: "Now if this really went on, do you think a father would accept money? Do you think that would make everything OK?

Michael Jackson Leaving Neverland: Fury over 'greedy' mums who left sons with 'predator'

 "It doesn’t make any sense. If that was my son, I don’t care if he gave me a billion dollars, I want to see you either behind bars or dead for doing that to my son. It’s crazy. The guy was after money. That is all he wanted." She went on to work with her brother on their hit 1995 single Scream but she has yet to comment on the Leaving Neverland documentary. Her nephew Taj claims she hasn't said anything because of fear: "I think there is a fear as well to put more energy to it and more eyeballs to it. "That’s why my aunt Janet hasn’t said anything because she doesn’t want to make it any bigger." What about Jackson's two wives Lisa Marie Presley and Debbie Rowe? In the documentary, both Robson and Safechuck claim Jackson would try to turn them against their parents and hate women.  Leading up to his brief marriage to Lisa Marie Presley in 1994 , the singer told Safechuck he "had to have public relationships with women" but "it wouldn't mean anything".

 The pair first met in 1975 when a seven-year-old Lisa Marie attended Michael's concert in Las Vegas. But a friend of the pair revealed their 'adult friendship' began in 1992. The daughter of Elvis and Priscilla, now 51, supported Michael through the child abuse claims that emerged in 1993 and has always denied seeing him commit any crimes. "I believed he didn't do anything wrong, and that he was wrongly accused and, yes, I started falling for him. I wanted to save him. I felt that I could do it," she said in The Magic and the Madness by J. Randy Taraborrello. After the allegations, Lisa-Marie had encouraged Michael to settle out of court and check into rehab when the stress left him self-medicating.

Michael Jackson's niece Brandi says she DATED Wade Robson and calls him liar

 In January 1996 Lisa-Marie filed for divorce citing irreconcilable differences. During an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2010, the singer revealed she and Michael spent four years after their split trying to reconcile.  Jackson met Debbie Rowe in 1996, the pair falling pregnant and getting married in the same year, but it's long being speculated that his two children to her Prince Michael and Paris were not biologically his.  She has remained steadfast on this, and when they divorced in 1999 he was awarded full custody of their children. Debbie has never defended Jackson against child abuse, but was called forward in the 2005 trial to testify his character. She hasn't commented on the latest allegations.

 What about Michael Jackson's music? Online reaction has largely been negative and in support of "cancelling" Jackson like R Kelly before him, but many of his loyal fans are refusing to quit on the legacy he left behind. BBC Radio 2 chose to drop the singer's music from their playlists ahead of the UK release of Leaving Neverland. The BBC said: “We consider each piece of music on its own merits and decisions what we play on different network are always made with relevant audiences and context in mind.”  However HuffPo reports that a jukebox musical based on the making of his 1992 world tour is set to open on Broadway in 2020, which is being developed by his estate.  Since his death in 2009, his estate has collected a reported $2.1 billion.
