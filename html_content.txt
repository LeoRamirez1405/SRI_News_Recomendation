The appeal at the High Court in Edinburgh centred on Tobin's claim that the sentence was excessive.A hearing relating to the appeal was due to take place on Friday this week.But the Scottish Court Service has now confirmed a Minute of Abandonment had been received and the appeal would not continue.The minute would have been submitted by Tobin's counsel on his behalf.In August, Ms Hamilton's father Michael, and Ian McNicol, whose 18-year-old daughter Dinah was also murdered by Tobin, called for him to be denied the right to a court appeal.The call was made after Tobin failed to turn up at the Court of Appeal in Edinburgh twice through illness.Mr Hamilton said at the time it was "ridiculous" that taxpayers' money was being spent on the appeal when the killer would spend the rest of his days in jail.Mr McNicol described the appeal as "a farce" and said Tobin was "a chancer".Tobin, from Johnstone in Renfrewshire, is serving another two life sentences for the murders of Polish student Angelika Kluk and Ms McNicol.He raped and killed Ms Kluk, 23, at a Glasgow church in September 2006.Ms McNicol vanished in August 1991 while hitchhiking to her home in Tillingham after leaving a music festival in Liphook, Hampshire. Her remains were found alongside those of Ms Hamilton.More on this storyTobin questioned over sex crimesPublished29 July 2010Fathers slam Tobin trial 'farce'Published22 July 2010Tobin's health delays appeal casePublished15 April 2010Around the BBCPeter TobinRelated Internet LinksScottish CourtsThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.From other local news sitesCouncillors approve 'absolutely necessary' 6.7% Angus rent riseExternalTayside and Fife CourierDaughter's heartfelt tribute to 'number one mum' after body found in DundeeExternalTayside and Fife CourierClosure date confirmed for Bo'ness Recreation CentreExternalFalkirk HeraldKiki Dee and her guitar man Carmelo set to star at Falkirk's Behind the WallExternalFalkirk HeraldShania Twain to headline Stirling Summer Sessions 2024ExternalAlloa & Hillfoots AdvertiserStirling Albion condemns damage to pitch at the IndodrillExternalAlloa & Hillfoots AdvertiserInformation about BBC links to other news sitesTop StoriesUphill battle for $95bn foreign aid bill in US HousePublished51 minutes agoBiden says Israel must protect vulnerable in RafahPublished5 hours agoLive.Â Up to 15in snow across north-east US as hundreds of flights cancelledFeaturesExclusive video: Trauma at every turn for Gazaâs exhausted paramedics.
